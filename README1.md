 Task 1: Software configuration Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hi, my name is Nazar. I took part in this program because I consider it a good opportunity for self-development and acquiring new skills. I also like to learn something new and test my strength and skills in solving various problems.

In addition, I took a software testing course and decided that I wanted to study in this direction. I am sure that in the future I will find a job to continue developing myself in this direction.
